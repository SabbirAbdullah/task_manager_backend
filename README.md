This is a Node.js + Express.js backend for a Todo application with JWT-based authentication.
The backend supports User Registration, Login, Forgot/Reset Password, and secure Todo CRUD operations.

It uses PostgreSQL (NeonDB) as the database and follows a clean, modular architecture with proper separation of routes, controllers, services, and repositories.
All protected APIs are secured using JWT Bearer Token authentication.
